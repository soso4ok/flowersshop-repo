   ```  
2. Build the project and download dependencies:  
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

### Configuration

If the application requires any external configuration (e.g., database URL, API keys), create a `config.properties` file in the `src/main/resources` directory and add your settings:

```properties
